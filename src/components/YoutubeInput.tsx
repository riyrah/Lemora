    precomputedSummary: `## üé• Video Overview
This talk explains why we procrastinate using fun characters like the Rational Decision-Maker, the Instant Gratification Monkey, and the Panic Monster. It explores why the monkey often wins and how deadlines force us into action.

## üìù Summary
- Everyone has a Rational Decision-Maker in their brain who plans for the future.
- Procrastinators also have an Instant Gratification Monkey who only cares about easy and fun things right now.
- The Monkey often takes the wheel from the Rational Decision-Maker, leading to activities like browsing the internet instead of working.
- This fun continues until a deadline gets very close, which awakens the Panic Monster.
- The Panic Monster is the only thing the Monkey is scared of, so it runs away when the Monster appears.
- This allows the Rational Decision-Maker to finally take control and get the work done in a stressful rush.
- The speaker notes that some procrastination happens on important tasks that don't have deadlines, which can be a source of long-term unhappiness because the Panic Monster never arrives to force action.

## üîë Main Ideas
- Procrastination is a battle between the part of us that plans rationally and the part that seeks immediate pleasure.
- Deadlines trigger panic, which is a (stressful) mechanism to overcome procrastination.
- Long-term procrastination on important, deadline-free goals is a serious issue because the panic trigger is absent.

## ‚ùì Why This Matters
Understanding the 'monkey' and the 'panic monster' helps us recognize why we procrastinate. It highlights the danger of putting off important life goals that don't have external deadlines to force us into action.

## üöÄ Try This
Think about a task you're putting off. Can you identify the Instant Gratification Monkey's influence? What could act as a 'Panic Monster' for you, even if you have to create mini-deadlines yourself?`,

    // Updated with detailed summary
    precomputedSummary: `## üé• Video Overview
This first lecture for Harvard's Advanced Algorithms course (COMPSCI 224) introduces the course structure, topics, and grading. It then dives into fundamental concepts of complexity theory, including the classes P and NP, and the significance of the P vs NP problem.

## üìù Summary
- Introduction and Logistics: Covers course staff, syllabus, prerequisites (strong algorithms/discrete math), and grading policy.
- Course Topics: Will include randomized algorithms, hashing, spectral methods, optimization, complexity theory, approximation algorithms, and more.
- Complexity Theory Intro: Focuses on classifying problems based on the computational resources (like time) required to solve them.
- Class P: Problems solvable by a deterministic algorithm in Polynomial time relative to the input size. Considered 'efficiently solvable'. Example: Sorting.
- Class NP: Problems where a potential solution can be Verified in Polynomial time. Example: Does a graph have a path that visits every city exactly once (Traveling Salesperson)? Verifying a given path is easy.
- P vs NP Problem: A major unsolved question - does P equal NP? If yes, any problem whose solution can be checked quickly can also be found quickly. Most believe P ‚â† NP.
- Importance: Understanding complexity helps determine if a problem is feasible to solve efficiently and guides algorithm design.

## üîë Main Ideas
- Advanced algorithms build upon core CS principles but explore more complex problems and techniques.
- Complexity classes (P, NP) categorize problem difficulty based on time/resource requirements.
- The P vs NP question is fundamental to understanding the limits of efficient computation.

## ‚ùì Why This Matters
Knowing if a problem is likely in P or NP-hard influences how we approach solving it. We might seek exact solutions for P problems but resort to approximations or heuristics for NP-hard ones.

## üöÄ Try This
Think about checking if a number is prime versus finding the prime factors of a large number. Which seems easier (likely in P)? Which seems harder to solve but potentially easy to verify if given the factors (likely in NP)?`,

    videoTitle: "The Essence of Calculus, Chapter 1",
    // Updated with detailed summary
    precomputedSummary: `## üé• Video Overview
This video visually introduces the fundamental ideas of calculus by exploring the problem of finding the area of a circle and relating it to the concepts of integrals and derivatives.

## üìù Summary
- Calculus helps understand change. The video uses finding the area of a circle as a central example.
- Approximation: We can approximate the circle's area by dividing it into many thin concentric rings (like tree rings).
- Unrolling the Rings: If we 'unroll' these rings, they form shapes that are almost rectangles.
- Creating a Graph: Plotting the circumference (2œÄr) of each ring against its radius (r) creates a straight-line graph (y=2œÄx).
- Area Connection: The total area of all the 'unrolled' rings approximates the area under the y=2œÄx graph, which forms a triangle.
- Area of Triangle: The area of this triangle is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * R * (2œÄR) = œÄR¬≤.
- Integral Calculus: This process of summing up infinitely many tiny pieces (the areas of the unrolled rings) to find the total area is the essence of integral calculus.
- Derivative Calculus: The inverse idea, finding the rate of change (how the area changes as the radius increases), relates to the circumference (2œÄR). This is the essence of derivative calculus.

## üîë Main Ideas
- Calculus tackles problems by breaking them down into infinitely small parts and analyzing how they add up or change.
- Integrals are about accumulation - summing up tiny quantities (like the area of thin rings) to get a whole.
- Derivatives are about instantaneous rates of change - how one quantity changes relative to another (like how circle area changes with radius).

## ‚ùì Why This Matters
This way of thinking allows us to solve complex problems involving curves, motion, growth, and optimization that are impossible with basic algebra alone.

## üöÄ Try This
Imagine slicing a sphere into thin circular disks. Can you relate the volume of the sphere to the area under some curve, similar to how the circle's area was related to the area under the circumference graph?`,
